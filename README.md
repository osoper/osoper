## Welcome 👋

My name is Owen, and this is my first repository.

Eventually, it will be a professional portfolio with a bunch of programs that I have worked on over the years.

For now, though, I'll just post a few things and make it look good later.

## Programming Experience 🖥️

Here are the programming languages that I have used:

<b> 6-12+ Months Experience: </b><br>
VBA | Python | Java

<b> <1-3 Months Experience: </b><br>
SQL | R | AMPL | HTML
